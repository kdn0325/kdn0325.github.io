## 에러 코드

```bash
[!] The following Swift pods cannot yet be integrated as static libraries:

The Swift pod `FirebaseCoreInternal` depends upon `GoogleUtilities`, which does not define modules. To opt into those targets generating module maps (which is necessary to import them from Swift when building as static libraries), you may set `use_modular_headers!` globally in your Podfile, or specify `:modular_headers => true` for particular dependencies.
```

---

## 원인

**Firebase 추가 후** `pod install` **에러**

---

## 해결

1. ios/Podfile

```bash
config = use_native_modules!
# 밑에 코드 추가 후
pod 'GoogleUtilities', :modular_headers => true

# pod install 다시 실행

```
